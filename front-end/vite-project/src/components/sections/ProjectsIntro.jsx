                        Below is a selection of projects I have completed through 
                        university and personal learning. These projects have helped 
                        me strengthen my programming skills and build a foundation in 
                        front-end, back-end and full-stack development. I plan to continue 
                        expanding these skills through future projects that focus on secure, 
                        well-designed and user-friendly applications.
